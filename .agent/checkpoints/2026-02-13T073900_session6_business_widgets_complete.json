      "DealAnalyzer (126 LOC): Shows real estate deal pipeline with active deals count, total pipeline value, under contract count. Displays up to 5 deals with address, city/state, strategy, status badges (color-coded), and purchase price. Filters out closed/dead deals automatically",
      "TradingDashboard (138 LOC): Portfolio snapshot widget showing total equity, day P&L (with color coding), cash/buying power, positions count, total P&L. Displays top 5 positions with symbol, quantity, and P&L. Calculates day P&L percentage automatically",
      "BusinessKPIs (141 LOC): Overview of business health showing active signals by severity (critical/urgent/attention/info with color-coded cards) and deal pipeline status breakdown (prospect/analyzing/offer/under_contract). Filters out dismissed signals automatically",
      "FinancialOverview (149 LOC): Combined financial view showing net worth (portfolio equity + deal pipeline value), portfolio allocation (cash vs positions percentage), and deal pipeline breakdown by strategy (flip/brrrr/rental/wholesale). Handles missing portfolio or deals gracefully",
      "Test coverage (254 LOC, 18 tests): Created factory helpers (makeDeal, makeSnapshot, makeSignal) with sensible defaults + overrides. Tests cover loading states, empty states, data rendering, calculations, color coding, and edge cases",
      "All components follow consistent patterns: named exports, dark theme (bg-slate-900/50, text-white, text-slate-300), lucide-react icons, presentational (receive data via props, no fetching), responsive grid layouts"
