## AR Real Estate Expert Glasses
**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Status:** Concept — Multimillion dollar potential

**Vision:** Connect AI vision (Stable Diffusion + image recognition) to smart glasses (Google Glass or similar) for real estate agents. When wearing the glasses, the agent becomes an instant expert on anything they see.

**How it works:**
- Agent walks into a luxury mansion wearing AR glasses
- Looks at architecture → AI identifies: "Mediterranean Revival style, circa 2005, inspired by Addison Mizner"
- Looks at furniture → "This is a Restoration Hardware Cloud sofa, $12,000 retail, designed by Timothy Oulton"
- Looks at marble countertops → "Calacatta Borghini marble, quarried in Carrara, Italy. One of the rarest white marbles — only 3 quarries produce it. Current price ~$180/sq ft installed"
- Looks at fixtures → "Waterworks Regulator gooseneck faucet, unlacquered brass, $2,400"
- Every detail is identified, contextualized, and fed to the agent in real-time

**Why it's valuable:**
- Real estate agents become instant experts in ANY property
- Builds massive credibility with luxury buyers
- No training required — the AI IS the expertise
- Works across all property types and price points
- Differentiator that justifies higher commission

**Tech stack needed:**
- Stable Diffusion / vision model for image recognition
- Real-time object detection + classification
- Materials/furniture/architecture knowledge base
- AR overlay rendering
- Low-latency edge compute (glasses can't wait for cloud round-trips)
- Google Glass / Meta Ray-Ban / custom hardware

**Revenue model:** SaaS for real estate brokerages, per-agent licensing, white-label for luxury brands
